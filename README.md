# GoT-Knn
A predictor of death for GoT characters working with the K-nearest-neighbors method

This little Knn software was created for a programmation course (Master in Cognitive Science at Lyon 2 university).

You need to have the 'working_got_knn.py' program and the 'base.csv' file to predict the death probability of a character with your own weighting, directly written in the code.
You need the 'weight.csv' file to work automaticaly with a dataset of weighting, and you can create your very own with the 'weight_gen' utilities or anything else.

The resluts are written in a *.txt file in the working directory.

This program is distributed with absolutely no warranty.
